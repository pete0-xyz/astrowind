### How can you offer 0% commission?
As a nonprofit organization, we operate differently from traditional real estate brokerages. Our operations are supported through grants, donations, and minimal administrative fees. This allows us to eliminate commission fees while still providing comprehensive real estate services.

### Are there any fees at all?
While we don't charge commission, there are standard closing costs and administrative fees associated with real estate transactions. We're transparent about these costs upfront and work to keep them as low as possible.

### How do you sustain your organization?
Our nonprofit model is sustained through a combination of grants, community support, and minimal administrative fees. This structure allows us to focus on our mission rather than profit maximization.

### What qualifies as a "permanent resident"?
A permanent resident is someone who intends to make the home their primary residence and main living space. This means you'll live in the home for the majority of the year and be an active part of our community.

### Do I need to be a current Paonia resident to work with you?
No, we welcome newcomers who are committed to making Paonia their permanent home. We'll help you understand our community and find the right neighborhood for you.

### What is your buying process like?
Our process includes an initial consultation to understand your needs and confirm your intention for permanent residency, followed by home search support and guidance through the entire purchase process.

### Will my home sell for less if I list with Permanent Homes?
We help you secure fair market value for your home. The difference is that we focus on finding buyers who will be permanent residents rather than investors or vacation home buyers.

### How do you screen potential buyers?
We have a thorough process to verify buyers' intentions for permanent residency. This includes detailed discussions about their community involvement plans and verification that the home will be their primary residence.

### Can I choose the buyer for my home?
Yes, you have full control over who purchases your home. We help you evaluate potential buyers based on both their financial qualifications and their commitment to being good stewards of your home's legacy.
